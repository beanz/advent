Advent of Code Coaster

![image of my advent of code coaster](coaster.png)

I used Inkscape to create the coaster but other tools would probably
work too.

The coaster.svg file is the main (editable) file. The other files were
generated by:

1. Converting the text elements in each layer to paths with "Stroke to Path".
2. Select all in all layers and flip along the vertical midpoint.
3. Hide all but one layer at a time saving each single layer as a file.

I then configured PrusaSlicer to "pretend" I had 4 extruders. This process
is described at in this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYwV8ijtSlg).

Then:

1. Load the black.svg file and extrude it 3mm.
2. Right click the black svg file and add a negative volume with the red.svg
   file and extrude it whatever the first layer height will be.
3. Repeat step 2 with the yellow and white svg files.
4. Load the red.svg file and extrude it to whatever the first layer height
   will be.
5. Repeat step 4 with the yellow and white svg files.
6. Make sure all the svg objects (and negative volumes) are positioned at
   the same center point.
7. Make sure that the svgs are all position correctly vertically - half
   the first layer height for red, yellow and white svg objects and
   negative volumes and 1.5mm (half 3mm) for the black.
8. Slice it and see if the first layer looks right.
9. You might need to move/configure the purge tower so it doesn't overlap
   the print.
10. The squares in each color are to aid lining things up be you can exclude
    them from the print if you want.
